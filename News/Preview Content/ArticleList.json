[+] USA) Getty Images If you are of a certain age, you will likely recall drama Felicity from J.J. Abrams ( Alias , Lost ) and Matt Reeves. It starred Keri Russell as Felicity Porter, a shy girl who finds out what life is like on her own following her high-school graduation. Translation: angst aplenty! Also prominently featured on Felicity were her two love interests: Scott Foley as Noel Crane (no relation to Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Frasier Crane), Felicity\u2019s resident advisor at fictional New York University; and Scott Speedman as fellow student Ben Covington. Other cast members included Tangi Miller, Greg Grunberg, Amanda Foreman, Donald Faison (pre- Scrubs ), Amy Jo Johnson, Ian Gomez, Rob Benedict, Amy Smart, Sarah-Jane Potts, Amy Aquino, Erich Anderson, Chris William Martin, and Janeane Garofalo. Celebrating 25 years since debuting on the long defunct network The WB on September 29, 1998, Felicity aired for four seasons (and 84 episodes). Now on Hulu, the streaming service has launched two \"best of\" collections on the series page. And that begs the question...what team are you on? Team Felicity and Ben, or Felicity and Noel?

    "content": "A California man who says he was harassed after Elon Musk amplified posts on his social media platform X, formerly known as , that falsely placed the man at a confrontation involving far-right protesters sued the billionaire for defamation in a lawsuit filed Monday. Benjamin Brody, 22, is represented by Mark Bankston, a Texas attorney who won a defamation case last year against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in a lawsuit brought by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. Brody is seeking a jury trial in Austin, Texas, and unspecified damages of at least $1 million. Attorneys for Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment left through a spokesperson. In June, video posted to X showed a confrontation involving protesters near a Pride festival in Oregon. Some of those involved wore the same colors of the Proud Boys extremist group, according to The Oregonian. On X, some users falsely identified one of the participants as Brody, highlighting his post-college plans to work for the government to spread baseless assertions that federal agents were involved. The lawsuit includes screenshots of Musk engaging with users spreading the posts involving Brody, including one in which Musk described it as a \u201Cprobable false flag situation.\u201D Brody, a recent college graduate who said he was in California when the event happened, came under harassment because of Musk's reach, according to the lawsuit. The posts by Musk were still on X as of Monday. It is not the first time Musk has been sued for defamation. He defeated a lawsuit in 2019 from a British cave explorer who claimed he was branded a pedophile when the Tesla CEO called him \u201Cpedo guy\u201D on what was then called Twitter. Musk's tech company has also taken others to court over what is posted on the site. In August, X sued a group of researchers over accusations that their work highlighting an increase in hate speech on the platform cost the company millions of dollars of advertising revenue.",

    "description": "Anthropologists specialize in, well, us. But studying humankind doesn't mean you have to hole up in a library or laboratory. Take a peek at this article to learn more about the dynamic, enriching field of anthropology.",
    "content": "Simply put, it is the study of human cultures and peoples. And perhaps we are a narcissistic bunch, but of all the organisms roaming Earth, one of the most fascinating creatures happens to be, well, us. All kidding aside, anthropology is perhaps one the most important academic pursuits humans undertake. That's because with anthropology, we not only gain a better understanding of where we came from, but we also develop a clearer picture of human behavior \u2014 and maybe even gain insight into the future of our species. Advertisement Anthropology is a far-reaching field that bridges a lot of academic disciplines. But suffice it to say that anthropologists (also sometimes called social scientists) don't spend all of their time poring over dusty natural history books in a dark corner of a university library. Rather anthropologists are among the most adventurous of researchers. They may travel all over the globe in search of answers to the toughest anthropological puzzles. Anthropology's ultimate aim, simply, is to comprehend human nature and cultural practices in all of its intricacy and diversity. Additionally, anthropologists explain the inner workings of really big social problems, such as disease epidemics, overpopulation and poverty. Advertisement For example, anthropologists specializing in medical anthropology might research maternal mortality in a developing nation. By highlighting factors such as a lack of health care, , a shortage of health workers, religious beliefs and educational shortfalls, these researchers' anthropological research helps build a picture of maternal mortality and its causes. With that understanding, they can propose solutions that might improve the lives of a lot of mothers and their families. Anthropologists work in nearly every segment of both the for-profit and nonprofit marketplaces. Both sectors need employees who can analyze and understand other human beings, either to increase revenue or to come up with theories and practical means for resolving pressing social problems. Whatever the specific end goal might be, anthropology is special in its long-term, cross-cultural perspective. It truly sets out to compare and study all aspects of the human experience. As you'll see next, it took the human species a while even to conceive of this kind of reflective analysis. Advertisement In 2005, Katrina wrecked many parts of the Gulf Coast region, leaving many people to wonder why the disaster happened and why the United States struggled to help its people. In the aftermath, anthropologists evaluated governmental responses to the storm, developed plans for resettlement, and studied how catastrophes like this impact both individuals and groups. In the end, the knowledge these scientists gained may help people the next time calamity strikes. Anthropology has existed for literally hundreds of years. The term first found its way into the English language in the late 16th century. But Western-style anthropology has existed since before the advent of Christianity. Ancient Greeks and Romans created powerful intellectual styles of thought that greatly influenced humanity's perspective on its place in the world. Advertisement Socrates and Plato, for example, taught critical thinking skills and philosophy. They also had a vital influence on how people perceive themselves and their place in the world \u2014 the kind of creative thinking that anthropologists (among many other types of thinkers) use constantly in their work. Around 1500, the development of philosophy began to rapidly accelerate, thanks to people like Ren\u00E9 Descartes, Voltaire, Immanuel Kant and many more. Suddenly, people everywhere were rethinking their perceptions of themselves and their world. For a long time, a lot of anthropological thinking relied on speculation. But as anthropology evolved, it moved from \"armchair anthropology,\" which relied heavily on academic, office-bound study and hypothetical scenario-building, into an interactive type of research in which scientists immerse themselves in the environment they are studying. In a minute, you'll see just how fully anthropologists plunge into their work. Advertisement For the moment, it's important to understand that in the United States, anthropology is divided into four different subfields: biological anthropology, , linguistic anthropology and social/cultural anthropology. Other countries, such as those in Europe, consider these subfields too distinct to lump together and instead treat each subject as its own field of study. But the so-called \"four-field\" approach in the United States is what many universities use to structure the anthropology department curriculum and guide students in their education. Advertisement Regardless of his or her specialty, an anthropologist has a lot of potential places to find work. In fact, you'll find anthropologists in places you might never have expected them to wander. Advertisement Anthropology often requires its students to fan out and scour the globe for answers to their questions. Enterprising anthropologists can find work in many diverse business environments. Corporations that trade globally need people who understand other cultures and can help develop relationships with societies that may be very different from their own. For example, a pharmaceutical company might want an expert on infant feeding routines or perhaps nutrition information specific to certain cultures. Nonprofit and public job markets also seek those with anthropological backgrounds. A medical center might be researching women's health issues and need expertise on the cultural acceptance of prenatal testing and family planning. Advertisement Yet no matter how well-meaning their research might be, anthropologists sometimes attract controversy. And one of the most contentious subjects regards the Yanomami Indians of the Amazon . Anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon visited this region in the 1960s to study this Indigenous people, and his writings and films turned the Yanomami into worldwide celebrities. Around the globe, people clamored for more information about the fascinating , while others started fundraising campaigns to \"save\" the Indians from their \"low-tech jungle lives\" instead of being seen as a group of people with practices that had helped them thrive for generations. Then things became even more chaotic. A journalist and Native rights activist named Patrick Tierney accused Chagnon of manipulating his findings to misrepresent the Yanomami. Tierney wrote, for example, that Chagnon made the Indians out to be a violent people who spent a lot of time fighting amongst each other, in part by purposely staging conflicts for video cameras to record. Tierney also blamed geneticist James Neel for unleashing a measles vaccine on the Yanomami that killed hundreds or thousands of people. Many people that he interviewed supported Tierney's findings but some vehemently denied them. Concrete proof of Yanomami exploitation and the epidemic hasn't been established. But this kind of situation shows the disturbances that can occur when scientists plunge headlong into another society \u2014 with their newfound fame, this Indigenous group was forever changed. As you'll read next, beyond the safe confines of their offices, anthropologists actively engage very different types of people, often in tense or even dangerous situations. Advertisement Anthropologists often pursue education as a career track, sharing their knowledge with university students. Many of those students might study anthropology in hopes of landing exciting fieldwork, perhaps in some far-flung location. And for these audacious souls, there is plenty of adventure to be had. For instance, they often work in disaster areas, helping organizations handle refugee crises or take on humanitarian problems in the aftermath of catastrophes, such as Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terror attacks. Advertisement Anthropologists may even take up residence in a new country so as to become fully engrossed in an unfamiliar culture. Doing so lets them readily observe and interact with locals and develop any necessary language skills. Embedded in this kind of intimate, close proximity research, anthropologists might encounter intense situations. Disease control organizations need social scientists to help understand certain populations, perhaps an ethnic subset in a large urban area that's suffering from an outbreak of a virus such as HIV. An anthropologist might explore the city, interact with sick and frightened people and try to help halt the virus' spread. Military units often employ anthropologists to help commanders develop a better understanding of an occupied land. In the , anthropologists interview local citizens to gauge their attitudes toward invading forces and to forge ties with local leaders, all in an attempt to increase safety and security for both citizens and soldiers. Work like this is dangerous, and anthropologists sometimes put their lives at risk. However, the pay is much higher than with cushier gigs. War zones aren't the only places anthropologists might encounter danger. Cities with gang violence problems send social scientists to interview and investigate the issues contributing to gang formation and violence. They might spend a lot of time directly in harm's way attempting to help citizens with conflict resolution and communication-development skills. These scientists might trade in harrowing adventures for safer jobs in a corporate or academic setting. Successful anthropologists who work as private consultants can build their resumes to fit specific interests, and they have the flexibility to change career paths. For example, they might dedicate much of their time to working on family planning challenges in developing countries, and then return to their country of origin to tackle the same kinds of problems. As academics and professionals, anthropologists are a lot like the human race itself \u2014 full of diversity and mystery, curiosity and wonder. Anthropology is truly a human endeavor that seeks deeper truths and knowledge about what human beings really are, and one that may help us guide our species' long-term survival. Advertisement",

Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin America most recently saw North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on the national stage after he clinched a qualifying spot at the second Republican presidential debate on September 27th. But, the North Dakota governor received the least amount of speaking time to any of his other 6 competitors onstage, clocking in at 7 minutes and 39 seconds , according to CNN. To his credit, Burgum did try to insert himself into the conversation \u2014 multiple times. The Republican governor interjected during Wednesday\u2019s debate on topics involving childcare, technology and energy. At one point, he asked, \"As the only person leading an energy state, can I answer the energy question?\" Fox News\u2019 Dana Perino swatted him down with an abrupt, one-word answer \u2014 \u201CNo.\u201D Burgum describes the presidential debates to Forbes as \u201Cpolitical theater.\u201D He points to his work in the private sector, paired with \u201Ccut[ting] red tape\u201D as North Dakota\u2019s governor, as the reasons why America should elect him to hold the nation\u2019s highest office. When it comes to issues regarding immigration, technology and energy, \u201Cwe\u2019re actually working on the solutions now \u2014 we\u2019re not waiting for 2024,\u201D Burgum explains to Forbes. Over the weekend, a government shutdown was narrowly avoided in the 11th hour after Congress passed a short term spending measure \u2014 and the bill received more Democratic support than Republican in the House. Infighting between far-right and more moderate House Republicans over spending cuts paved the way for the near shutdown. Burgum, who regards himself as a \u201Cprivate sector leader,\u201D says that \u201Cit\u2019s not helpful for our country \u2014 or for the Republican Party \u2014 if people think that we\u2019re not able to lead.\u201D Tensions have been so high on the Republican side of the House that Rep.

    "description": "California has repealed a misinformation law that restricted the advice doctors could give patients about COVID-19, bowing to mounting legal pressure.",
    "content": "Back Print By Sean Salai - The Washington Times - Updated: 6:35 p.m. on Monday, October 2, 2023 California has repealed a misinformation law that restricted the advice doctors could give patients about COVID-19, bowing to mounting legal pressure. The legislation was signed into law in September 2022 and took effect in January. It tried to define COVID disinformation as \u201Cunprofessional conduct\u201D and empower the Medical Board of California to revoke the licenses of physicians who diverged from \u201Ccontemporary scientific consensus.\u201D A federal judge halted the law in January pending court challenges, and it is unclear that officials ever enforced it. Over the weekend, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a state Senate bill repealing the section of the state\u2019s Business and Professions Code containing the law, according to a Saturday post on the governor\u2019s website that offered no comment on the action. The nullification should take effect in January, one year after the law took effect. Attorneys from the Liberty Justice Center, a Chicago nonprofit legal firm that argued against the legislation in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on July 17, announced its repeal Monday. \u201CWe\u2019re glad California repealed this bill before it could spread to other states, and we\u2019re proud to have defended our clients\u2019 First Amendment rights,\u201D said Jacob Huebert, president of the Liberty Justice Center. The Washington Times has reached out to the governor\u2019s office for comment. In a signing statement appended to the law on Sept. 30, 2022, Mr. Newsom acknowledged it could have a \u201Cchilling effect\u201D on free speech. But he said lawmakers had carefully drafted it to deal with abuses and entrusted its interpretation to the Medical Board of California. The law, he wrote, \u201Cis narrowly tailored to apply only to those egregious instances in which a licensee is acting with malicious intent or clearly deviating from the required standard of care while interacting directly with a patient under their care.\u201D Several California physicians disagreed and challenged the board\u2019s right to define treatment. They filed three separate lawsuits against state officials to overturn the legislation in October, November and December 2022. Drs. Tracy Hoeg, Ram Duriseti, Aaron Kheriaty, Pete Mazolewski and Azadeh Khatibi argued in a November 2022 suit that the law interfered with their ability to give patients timely advice as new COVID variants emerged. The New Civil Liberties Alliance, a public interest law firm, represented them in the Eastern District of California. U.S. District Senior Judge William B. Shubb, a President George H.W. Bush appointee, granted them a preliminary injunction against the law in a Jan. 25 ruling. \u201CGovernor Newsom and the state legislature saw the writing on the wall after Judge Shubb\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction in January.\u201D Jenin Younes, an NCLA attorney involved in the case, said Monday. Liberty Justice Center filed the first suit against the legislation on Oct. 4, 2022 \u2014 a few days after Ms. Newsom signed it into law \u2014 in California\u2019s Central District. Drs. Mark McDonald, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, and Jeff Barke, an Orange County primary care physician, argued in that complaint that the law violated their constitutional right to free speech and the spirit of scientific inquiry. In statements on Monday, the two doctors expressed mixed feelings about their legal victory. \u201CWhat a shame that it required the precious resources of time, money and stress to preserve our constitutional rights of free speech and medical freedom,\u201D Dr. Barke said. \u201CWe need real accountability, or this will happen again,\u201D added Dr. McDonald. \u2022 Sean Salai can be reached at ssalai@washingtontimes.com .

    "description": "Series creator Annie Weisman and director Stephanie Laing talk about the Apple TV+ series 'Physical' and the challenges women have always faced with body and food issues.",
    "content": "Forbes Business Hollywood & Entertainment \u2018Physical\u2019 Bravely Tackled Women\u2019s Issues With Their Bodies, Food, And Recovery Dana Feldman Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I watch a lot of shows and write about those that are worth the binge. Following Oct 2, 2023, 06:24pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Dierdre Friel and Rose Byrne gave award-worthy performances in 'Physical' on Apple TV+. Photo Courtesy of Apple TV+. Sheila Rubin was cruel, primarily to herself. She was also unkind to those around her. But if you were a fan of the Apple TV+ series Physical , you rooted for her to get to the bottom of her self-loathing and highly judgmental critical thinking because you knew that, at its core, there was pain. As the saying goes, hurt people hurt people. Physical was a brilliant series about how women see themselves, view their bodies, and treat themselves. Rose Byrne was phenomenal as Sheila. She deserved awards attention that didn\u2019t come. Her performance was raw, dark, and unabashedly honest. The series, created by Annie Weisman, was an overlooked masterpiece that flew under the radar for three seasons and 30 flawless episodes. Weisman took risks in her storytelling. She made her directorial debut this season with the second to last episode. Set in 1980s San Diego, this dark comedy followed Sheila as she aimed to change women's lives with aerobics. The viewer was privy to her every thought as we eavesdropped on her inner voice, which was relentless. Her cutting words narrated and drove the story. Fans stuck by her as she tried to find a way to quiet this part of her psyche, but her self-hatred wouldn't be silenced. This wife, mother and soon-to-be fitness entrepreneur would eventually find a way to move beyond her demons, haunting childhood trauma and overall dissatisfaction with her life. However, the journey would be rife with challenges.

In separate interviews, Weisman and Stephanie Laing, who directed 24 episodes, each confirmed that Sheila was an amalgamation of many women of that era. \u201CJane Fonda inspired us, among others. We looked at a lot of people in the 80s, and I can\u2019t tell you how many workout videos we watched as research over the life of the series,\u201D said Laing. \u201CSheila embodies all of them and our personal experience with the main issue of the series.\u201D Though superb in its telling, Physical was sometimes hard to watch, possibly because many women can relate to that inner relentlessly scathing voice. Weisman wrote Physical several years ago and based much of the story on her life growing up in the late 1970s/early 1980s in a Southern California beach town near San Diego. As a longtime TV writer, she knew what it took to sell a script. She also knew this story was very unique. \u201CI just wanted to get to something honest and true about my own experience as a female in the world,\u201D said Weisman. \u201CI wanted to explore all these contradictions in this world of Southern California fitness culture that I grew up in and the differences between the surface and the reality.\u201D Weisman set the story in this era because it was the beginning of the workout craze at a time when women craved freedom and independence. \u201CDivorce was on the rise. Women were still very limited in their options. It was also a time when exercise was considered to be a radical thing. The idea of sweating or being strong, there were these women who were starting to do it. And starting a business around it? It was the beginning of when that was even conceivable for a woman to do.\u201D Weisman felt it was her mission to give credit to the pioneers of the exercise movement. \u201CIt was risky for the women who started this industry. There was so much backlash.\u201D Weisman also wanted to showcase another kind of female power. \u201CI wanted to show the possibilities of recovery for someone in mid-life. I needed to talk about eating disorders as not just something that occurs in adolescence. There are waves of this that happen to women throughout their lives. In mid-life, marriage doesn't cure it. Being a mom doesn't fix it. It\u2019s still true, more so now than ever.\u201D Though Weisman acknowledges that there\u2019s more body inclusivity today, she says there\u2019s still a bombardment of images of female bodies and discussions about female bodies that we\u2019re subjected to. \u201CWe tried to be realistic about what recovery is. You don't have to get to a place of constant self-love. For me, recovery looks like something more realistic, which is to say, you can look in the mirror and not always like what you see but have better things to do with your life than to obsess about it. That, to me, is the goal.\u201D Weisman reflected on the era. \u201CJudi Sheppard Missett was starting Jazzercise right around the corner from me. There was also Jenny Craig, who was from my hometown, starting her diet empire. This idea of women who could create an entrepreneurial avenue for themselves was all beginning at the time.\u201D On its surface, Physical looks like a fun show with its 80s soundtrack and fashion. It\u2019s so much more layered. Weisman summed it up best. \u201CIt\u2019s about women and how we view ourselves, speak to ourselves, and treat ourselves.\u201D Rose Byrne as Sheila Rubin in 'Physical' on Apple TV+. Photo Courtesy of Apple TV+. As for inviting the audience in regarding Sheila\u2019s every dark thought, Weisman had the idea of sharing her innermost feelings in a daring way. Byrne took on this acting challenge and nailed it in every episode with bone-chilling voiceovers. \u201CWhat was really at the core of our storytelling was that contradiction between the surface and what was inside. It\u2019s a creative representation of that divide that many of us feel. It was how I represented how disconnected I often felt,\u201D Weisman confessed. We heard Sheila loud and clear. She was as harsh on herself as she was on others. She struggled with her body, had an unhealthy relationship with food, and felt trapped in her life. Her issues remain relatable today. Of the lack of awards attention, which was surprising due to the show\u2019s sharp writing and flawless acting, Laing suspects the subject matter might have triggered some viewers. \u201CI don't think viewers expected a woman\u2019s inner voice to be so critical and harsh. That might have put some people off because that\u2019s hard to face, right? If you\u2019re not used to that, it\u2019s like, \u2018Is that real? Do women talk and think about themselves like that and in that way?\u2019 And the truth is, \u2018Yes.\u2019 If you expected this would be this fun 80s music and aerobics show, that\u2019s not what it is. It\u2019s an intense show about a complex woman with many issues.\u201D These issues are why Laing felt it was urgent to tell Sheila\u2019s story. \u201CThis is a show about women and body issues and living up to standards in the 80s to today. You could change the wardrobe, and this show would feel very current. It probably is hard for people to watch if they\u2019re not ready to recognize some things about themselves. I think it affects so many women.\u201D It was also a celebratory series as we see the payoff for Sheila and those in her life. She finds freedom, and so do those around her. \u201CThat\u2019s what I hope people take from the series, too, that we should be celebrating our bodies and embracing ourselves,\u201D added Laing. \u201CIf there\u2019s any way this series can help people with that, then that\u2019s what we want. And then, of course, bringing attention to disordered eating and intrusive thoughts about that.\u201D Physical was also a show about female friendship. We meet Sheila at a transitional time in her life. She met Dierdre Friel\u2019s Greta, who, on the surface, appeared to be her polar opposite. But these two women had so much more in common than either could\u2019ve imagined. Rory Scovel, Ian Gomez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Della Saba, and Paul Sparks rounded out this fabulous ensemble cast. Murray Bartlett, Whitney Cummings, and Zooey Deschanel also guest-starred over the seasons. As for the finale, Weisman and Laing both said the aim was to send a hopeful message. Laing confirmed that, for now, this is where we bid farewell to Sheila and her inner circle. If they were to pick the story up in the future, they\u2019d likely explore recovery, which is a long road for Sheila. \u201CFor now, she\u2019s free. Sheila is accepting of her body. All the characters are in a good place. Everyone has a sense of hope for the future.\u201D Weisman agreed. \u201CWe tried very hard to tell this story honestly. We hope people watched the finale and felt a sense of hope.\u201D It\u2019s a challenging topic, dissecting women\u2019s issues with their bodies. \u201COne of the thrills of making this show was to dance up to that edge and tell the truth,\u201D said Weisman. \u201CWhen you do that, it\u2019s risky. Some viewers might be afraid to watch. Not everybody is ready to look at themselves. I certainly wasn\u2019t. It took me decades to even write this and tell the truth about my own experiences, so I\u2019m certainly sympathetic to that point of view.\u201D Ultimately, Weisman gave Sheila and the viewers a satisfying ending. \u201CI felt a responsibility to be authentic about the sacrifices it took to get that ending for her. I wanted to leave her in that place. So much time and energy go into an eating disorder. I wanted to show that recovery is available at any age and that there is a lot of freedom in letting go.\u201D Follow me on Twitter . Dana Feldman Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",
